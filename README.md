# random-projects

A repo for all the unsorted things that didn't get a repo  

## Database:  
1. Database Merger report | Microsoft WWI Sample DB and DW datasets.
2. Emergency Transport/Ambulance Database design


## pdfJoiner (135 Final Project):  
6/4-6/9 - I did the take-home "final exam" with raw linear algebra as a challenge, just because I could - not using libraries that would have made them one liners. This was extremely difficult but provided a lot of value as I had to have a strong understanding of the transformations required to create each statistic. I'm glad I did it this way.


## Hide-n-Seek-FAANG:  
A collection of the hidden embedded files I've found while webscrapping websites. You know how people can see when you opened their email by embedding a link to load a tiny little jpg? I found the links for these.


## Linkedin
I don't plan on actually using these on people, don't worry!
### webscrapper (crawler!) Development Timeline:  
6/27 - Created notebook

### LazyJobFiller - 1:
Fills in my job applications spreadsheet's nan's after I apply for a job and paste the link, good way to prevent spam calls (keep track of who you've applied to)
Development timeline: 10/05/2022 5:47PM - 6:40PM
